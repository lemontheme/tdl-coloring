# TDL-coloring (package)
Atom package that adds basic support for TDL (Type Description Language) syntax. This means accurate syntax highlighting/font locking when editing DELPH-IN-stye `.tdl` and `.mtr` files, provided the conventions described in *Implementing Typed Feature Structures* (Copestake 2002) are followed. 

## Note 
This package was thrown together in an afternoon and has been refined (lazily, and to the best of my ability) based on my own needs while working within a LinGO Matrix-based framework. Should you encounter unexpected or annoying behaviour, yet feel reluctant to switch to Emacs just for the sake of *tdl-mode.el* (packaged with the LKB), feel free to leave a suggestion. Other contributions are welcome, too! :)
